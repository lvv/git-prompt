= GIT Prompt

:v-p:		http://volnitsky.com/project
:compact-option: compact


== Basic Usage

image:screenshot-prompt-basic.png[basic usage]

Digit [red]*1* on 3rd line is `false(1)` exit code. Also on non-zero exit code
terminal bell is sounded.  Bell is turned off by default (to set softer
terminal bell use `setterm`).


== GIT

Branch and files are colored according to state. "M" stands for master.

==  Subversion/SVN 
image:screenshot-svn.png[svn module screenshot]

SVN module disabled by default because even on moderate sized working
directories there is noticeable delay for prompt display.  SVN is slower than
GIT.  Enable if needed in <<config,config>> 

==  Mercurial/HG
HG module was developed by Lee Nussbaum `<wln AT scrunch.org>`.


== Labels

Labels are visual cues to help figure out what terminal is running what command.
It is generalization of xterm-title but differ from xterm-title that it
can be displayed in other places (on Screen(1) windows titles for example).
Also label can display currently executed command (when bash prompt obviously
is not displayed). Because labels have less space then prompt, instead of full path
only last dir is shown.
On screenshot below labels are in red ovals.

image:screenshot-labels.png["labels screenshot", width="300", link="screenshot-labels.png"]

The `screen(1)` status line at bottom of smaller gnome-terminal is displayed with
following line in `~/.screenrc`:

---------
caption always "%{= kw}%-w%{= bw}%n %t%{-}%+w %-= @%H - %LD %d %LM - %c"
---------


== Simple AutoJump

AutoJump is python script from Joel Schaerer providing shortcuts for jumping
to directories you once visited.  Git-prompt have built-in, simplified
autojump. It is only about 10 lines of bash code (vs original 100+ python
LOC), there is no database. It remembers only directories from current
session. It selects not most frequent dir, but last visited. Matches are done
from beginning of of dir name (not path name).

-----------------
cd /tmp                                                                                                                                      
cd "~/long dir mp3"
cd "~/long dir mp4"
cd /tmp
cd /var/tmp
cd /etc 
cd
j t     # same as  cd /var/tmp
j .*3   # same as  cd "~/long dir mp3"
-------------


== Install
Download  link:git-prompt.sh[] or get it with GIT:

------------------
  git clone git://github.com/lvv/git-prompt.git
---------------

Put following command at the end of your profile (`~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`) 

--------------------
  [[ $- == *i* ]]   &&   . /path/to/git-prompt.sh
---------------------

There might be your old prompt defined too.  You can comment it out. 
Some distros also have `/etc/bashrc` or `/etc/bash/bashrc` with distro default
prompt.


== Config 
[[config]]

Is optional.  If config file is not found then git-prompt uses defaults. 
Defaults are listed in example `git-prompt.conf`.  Git-prompt looks (in listed order)
for config file in following locations:

* `/etc/git-prompt.conf`
* `~/.git-prompt.conf`

Copy example config `git-prompt.conf` 
to any of above locations and customize as needed.


== Limitations

* cd-ing into something like linux kernel git working directory for the 1st
  time (with cold cache) might take up to 10 seconds (that is how long `git status` executes).
  Use `vcs_ignore_dir_list` in config if you want to ingnore such dirs.
* Because you will be always reminded about dirty repo (not checked-in files),
  you will maintain `.gitignore` and commit more often.
* This prompt is most useful if your screen have enough width.
  If this is not the case, you might want to disable file list display (`max_file_list_length=0`).
* When prompt is longer than screen-width it wraps to second line. This is always undesirable. 
  Because of bug in `gnome-terminal` (or `readline` ?) some color escape codes can be visible on second line. 
  I've reported gnome-terminal bug.  Again, you can disable file list display or limit length (`max_file_list_length`).
* By default some terminals display ascii color with maximum color saturation
  which makes colored text of different perceptual brightness.  This makes it hard to read. 
  If your terminal colors are configurable, try change it to softer (pastel)
  colors.


== Dependencies

Most probably you don't need to install anything because not optional
dependencies are standard unix utils. 

* bash  (tested with v3.2.33) 
* sed
* tput  (terminfo)
* tty  (core utils)
* grep
* locale  (glibc)
* id   (core utils)
* cksum (core utils)

* git  (optional)
* svn  (optional)
* hg   (optional)


== Todo

* Subshells number indicator. Don't know how to do this. There is bash
  `"\j"`, but let say I want `">>"` after path instead of `">"` when I have 2 jobs 
  running. Running `+++`jobs | ... `+++` is extra bash fork, hate to do this. 
* VIM module needs to be moved out of GIT module


include::../volnitsky.com/project/howto-submit-patch.txt[]

Nobody will use git-prompt if there will be delay in prompt display.
Try to avoid use of external commands and
subshells (backticks) in prompt_command_function.  It is ok to use
time consuming ops in postconfig which is executed only once.
